# Dunes

A minter and protocol for dunes on Dogecoin.

You can find general information about Dunes [here](./DUNES.md).

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Important ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use this wallet for dunes only! Always mint from this wallet to a different address. This wallet is not meant for storing funds or dunes.

## Prerequisites

To use this, you'll need to use your console/terminal and install Node.js on your computer. So please ensure, that you have your

### Install NodeJS

Please head over to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the installation instructions.

### Launch your own RPC

In order to inscribe, you will need to have access to a Dogecoin RPC. For example: [https://getblock.io/](https://getblock.io/) provides a service to get access to an RPC.
You will need that for the configuration.

## Setup

### git clone and install

Install by git clone (requires git and node on your computer)

#### git clone

```
git clone https://github.com/sirduney/dunes-cli.git
```

**or**

download this [zip file](https://github.com/verydogelabs/do20nals/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and upack in a directory.


Now open your terminal and change to the directory the sources are installed.

```
cd <path to your download / installation e.g. "C:\Doginals-Main">
npm install audit fix
```

After all dependencies are solved, you can configure the environment:

### Configure environment

Copy a `.env.example` to `.env` and add your node information. Here are also some recommended settings:

```
PROTOCOL_IDENTIFIER=D
NODE_RPC_URL=http://<ip>:<port>
# This is optional if you have an RPC from getblock.io
NODE_RPC_USER=<username>
NODE_RPC_PASS=<password>
TESTNET=false
FEE_PER_KB=50000000
ORD=https://wonky-ord-v2.dogeord.io/
```

You can get the current fee per kb from [here](https://blockchair.com/).

## Funding

Generate a new `.wallet.json` file:

```
node dunes.js wallet new
```

Then send DOGE to the address displayed. Once sent, sync your wallet:

```
node dunes.js wallet sync
```

If you are minting a lot, you can split up your UTXOs:

```
node dunes.js wallet split <splits>
```

When you are done minting, send the funds back:

```
node dunes.js wallet send <address> <amount>
```

## Dunes

Deploy a dune:

```
node dunes.js deployOpenDune 'RANDOM•DUNE•NAME' <symbol> <limit-per-mint> <decimals> <max-nr-of-mints> <mint-absolute-start-block-height> <mint-absolute-stop-block-height> <mint-relative-start-block-height> <mint-relative-end-block-height> <amount-premined-to-deployer> <opt-in-for-future-protocol-changes> <minting-allowed> [parentId]
```

**Note**: The `[parentId]` parameter is optional and links the new Dune to a parent inscription by specifying its inscription ID (e.g., `e6c6efe91b6084eae2c8a2fd6470d3d0dbfbb342f1b8601904f45be8095058e2i0`). To use this, the parent inscription’s private key must be in your wallet (`.wallet.json`).

**Example**:

```
node dunes.js deployOpenDune 'RANDOM•DUNE•NAME' 'R' 100000000 8 null null null null 100 100000000 false true e6c6efe91b6084eae2c8a2fd6470d3d0dbfbb342f1b8601904f45be8095058e2i0
```

This deploys a Dune named `RANDOM•DUNE•NAME` with symbol `R`, a limit of 100000000 per mint, 8 decimals, and premines 1R (100 atomic units) to the deployer. It’s linked to the parent inscription `e6c6...i0`

Mint a dune:

```
node dunes.js mintDune <id> <amount> <to>
```

Example:

```
node dunes.js mintDune '5088000:50' 100000000 DTZSTXecLmSXpRGSfht4tAMyqra1wsL7xb
```

Mass mint a dune:

```
node dunes.js batchMintDune <id> <amount> <number-of-mints> <to>
```

Example (this will do 100x mints):

```
node dunes.js batchMintDune '5088000:50' 100000000 100 DTZSTXecLmSXpRGSfht4tAMyqra1wsL7xb
```

Get the ID here from: [Wonky Dogeord](https://wonky-ord-v2.dogeord.io/dunes)

Print the balance of an address:

```
node dunes.js printDuneBalance <dune-name> <address>
```

Example:

```
node dunes.js printDuneBalance WHO•LET•THE•DUNES•OUT DTZSTXecLmSXpRGSfht4tAMyqra1wsL7xb
```

Split dunes from one output to many:

```
node dunes.js sendDuneMulti <txhash> <vout> <dune> <decimals> <amounts> <addresses>
```

Example:

```
node dunes.js sendDuneMulti 15a0d646c03e52c3bf66d67c910caa9aa30e40ecf27f495f1b9c307a4ac09c2e 1 WHO•LET•THE•DUNES•OUT 8 2,3 DDjbkNTHPZAq3f6pzApDzP712V1xqSE2Ya,DTnBdk1evnpbKe1qeCoeATHZnAVtwNR2xe
```

Combine dunes from multiple outputs to one:

```
node dunes.js sendDunesNoProtocol <address> <utxo-amount> <dune>
```

Example:

```
node dunes.js sendDunesNoProtocol DDjbkNTHPZAq3f6pzApDzP712V1xqSE2Ya 10 WHO•LET•THE•DUNES•OUT
```

### Parent Inscriptions
You can link a new Dune to an existing "parent" inscription (e.g., an image or another Dune) using the optional `[parentId]` parameter in `deployOpenDune`. This creates a hierarchical relationship between digital assets.

**Requirements**:
- The parent inscription’s private key must be in your wallet (`.wallet.json`), as the script spends its UTXO to establish the link.
- The `parentId` must be a valid inscription ID in the format `txid:iN` (e.g., `e6c6efe91b6084eae2c8a2fd6470d3d0dbfbb342f1b8601904f45be8095058e2i0`), where `txid` is the transaction ID and `N` is the output index.

**Why Use It?**:
- Organize related Dunes under a single parent (e.g., linking single or multiple Dunes to an image).
- Build structured collections with parent-child relationships.

**Important Notes**: 
- This feature is optional. Dunes can be etched without a parent if no `parentId` is provided.

- This "Requires" the parent’s private key to be accessible in the wallet.

- Ensure that the parent inscription’s private key is accessible in the wallet derived from your MetaMask seed phrase. This is necessary because the transaction will spend the parent UTXO to establish the parent-child relationship
## Pay Terms (New)


### Apply Pay Terms

***You can now **charge a mint price** on your Dune etchings:***

- **priceAmount**  
  A u128 string of shibes (1 DOGE = 100 000 000 shibes) to charge per mint, or `null` to disable fees.

- **pricePayTo**  
  A Dogecoin address to receive collected fees, or `null`.

When **both** `priceAmount` and `pricePayTo` are set in the `deployOpenDune` command, your Dune will carry on‑chain pay terms. Minters must pay that fee, and proceeds go straight to the specified address.

**Example with Pay Terms**:

```
node dunes.js deployOpenDune \
  'RANDOM•DUNE•NAME' \
  'R' \
  100000000 \
  8 \
  null null null null \
  100 \
  100000000 \
  false \
  true \
  e6c6efe91b6084eae2c8a2fd6470d3d0dbfbb342f1b8601904f45be8095058e2i0 \
  5000000 \
  DDogeFeeRecipientAddress
```

***Important Notes:***
"apply pay terms” is the Key: it lets you set a mint price (in “shibes”) and specify who gets paid when someone mints a Dune. Previously, we could only open‐mint with limits, caps, and block‑height restrictions, etc.; now we can also monetize it by charging a fee and directing that fee to an address of your choice.
You also refactored the internal broadcast() function’s retryAsync call so it passes the helper directly instead of wrapping it in an extra async lambda:

res = await retryAsync(async () => await makePostRequest(), 10, 30000);
res = await retryAsync(makePostRequest, 10, 30000);
This doesn’t change behavior, it does makes the retry logic a bit cleaner!

Why im Digging this upgrade???
Monetization: Projects can now sustainably fund themselves by charging a shibe‑denominated mint fee.

**Flexibility:**

 Since the fee is just another field in the Terms object, it’s fully optional, so if you don’t want a fee, you pass "null" and everything behaves exactly like before.
Such Flexibility!!!

**Backward‑compatible:**

Existing scripts and deployments that never set a price will continue to work unchanged.

**Decentralization & Dogecoin ethics:**

***On‑chain enforcement only:***

 All the fee logic happens in your local CLI client and then on‑chain via the same RPC calls and smart‑contract‑style logic Dunes has always used. There’s no off‑chain "Gatekeeper" or "Centralized service" validating payments.

**User choice:**

 Anyone can deploy an open mint with or without a fee; you’re not forced to pay if you don’t want to.

**Transparent rules:**

All parameters (limits, heights, offsets, fees, pay‑to address) are encoded in the same public transaction data we’ve always put on Dogecoin.

**No new trust assumptions:**

You still only need to trust the Dogecoin network itself and your own keypair....there’s no additional trusted infrastructure introduced.

*In short, it’s Such a clean, opt‑in extension that preserves the fully decentralized ethos of Dogecoin.*

*Much Innovation, Such Decentralized, So Dunes
Well done Fam! Thanks for the Great Idea* @reallyshadydev  https://x.com/reallyshadydev


## FAQ

### I'm getting ECONNREFUSED errors when minting

There's a problem with the node connection. Your `dogecoin.conf` file should look something like:

```
rpcuser=ape
rpcpassword=zord
rpcport=22555
server=1
```

Make sure `port` is not set to the same number as `rpcport`. Also make sure `rpcauth` is not set.

Your `.env file` should look like:

```
NODE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:22555
NODE_RPC_USER=ape
NODE_RPC_PASS=zord
TESTNET=false
```

### I'm getting "insufficient priority" errors when minting

***The miner fee is too low. You can increase it up by putting FEE_PER_KB=300000000 in your .env file or just wait it out. The default is 100000000 but spikes up when demand is high.***
